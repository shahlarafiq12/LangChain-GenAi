# LangChain-GenAi

## This project demonstrates how to use LangChainâ€™s SequentialChain to connect multiple LLMChains.

- Chain 1 generates a topic from a given subject.

- Chain 2 expands on that topic with a detailed paragraph.

- The final output includes both the generated topic and text.

- A simple hands-on exercise for practicing input/output flow between chains in LangChain.
